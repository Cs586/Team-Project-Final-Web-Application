### Details

Main calendar view:

Create new task view:

Supports a basic drag & drop on desktop of days (like Google Calendar), edition of existing tasks, creation of repetitive tasks (daily, montly, by weekday, by month day or on specific day number), custom colors, and a few options like hiding past tasks or being able to manually hide those repetitive task ocurrences (I like a "clean view" and usually remove/hide past tasks).

It is mobile friendly (buttons for actions are ugly and cannot drag & drop days on mobile, but otherwise works), might not be perfectly designed for all resolutions but at least works.



## Docker Environment

- Development strongly encourages using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Running
For running docker compose: build/dev/docker-compose.yml

Sample username is `a_username` with password `a_password`.

## Miscellaneous

### User creation/deletion

As there is no admin interface, to create or delete users you should create a python file with code similar to the following example:

```python
from authentication import Authentication
import config


authentication = Authentication(data_folder=config.USERS_DATA_FOLDER, password_salt=config.PASSWORD_SALT)

# Create a user
authentication.add_user(
    username="a username",
    plaintext_password="a plain password",
    default_calendar="a default calendar id"
)

# Delete a user
authentication.delete_user(username="a username")
```
